**Alkaline phosphatase** An enzyme produced by osteoblasts that is believed to play a role in the mineralization of bone

**Apoptosis** Programmed cell death 

**Bone remodeling** A process that couples bone resorption by osteoclasts with deposition by osteoblasts (new bone cells) 

**Chondroblasts** The cells that form cartilage 

**Cortical bone** Dense bone, literally “bark,” that is responsible for skeletal homeostasis 

**Diaphysis** The shaft of a long bone 

**Endochondral ossification** The formation of bone within a cartilage model 

**Epiphysis** The region of bone across the physis, just below the articular cartilage 

**Hematopoiesis** The process of forming blood cells 

**Hypertrophic zone** A layer of large, plump cells in the physis that assists in mineralization of the cartilage 

**Infarct** An area of tissue that is cut off from its blood supply, becomes ischemic, and dies 

**Lamellar bone** Mature, well-organized form of cortical bone 

**Medullary canal** The relatively hollow central core of a long bone that houses bloodforming cells 

**Metaphysis** The region of bone just below the physis 

**Mineral homeostasis** The function of bone responsible for the storing and releasing of ions, principally calcium 

**Morphogenesis** The development of the skeleton in utero 

**Osteoblasts** The cells that synthesize the organic component of bone; also thought of as the bone-forming cells 

**Osteoclasts** Large cells that resorb bone matrix when activated 

**Osteocytes** The cells of established bone Periosteum A sleeve of connective tissue that surrounds the shaft of the bone and contributes to fracture healing 

**Physis** The growth plate 

**Proliferative zone** A layer of stacked cells in the physis that synthesizes proteoglycans for the cartilaginous matrix; also has the most extensive blood supply within the physis 

**Reserve zone** A layer of cells in the physis that produces the cartilaginous matrix for ossification into bone 

**Skeletal homeostasis** The function of bone that supplies structural support and movement for the body 

**Trabecular bone** Bone characterized by its “lattice” appearance and is responsible for mineral homeostasis 

**Wolff’s law** A law that states that the growth and remodeling of bone is influenced and modulated by mechanical stresses 

**Woven bone** Primitive, less-organized form of cortical bone
