At the physis, chondrocytes proliferate, mature, and secrete extracellular matrix, which eventually ossifies. The physis is polar: moving away from the epiphysis and joint surface toward the metaphysis, there is increasing maturation of the cells. Just below the epiphysis is a zone of immature resting cells; just above the metaphysis, calcification takes place in the setting of programmed cell death (apoptosis) of the hypertrophic chondrocytes. New bone formation thus occurs at the point farthest from the articular surface, at the junction between the physis and the metaphysis. This region is named the zone of provisional calcification. The physis itself is divided into three major zones: the reserve zone, the proliferative zone, and the hypertrophic zone (Fig. 3). ![](MM-01-001-fig03.png "Figure 3. The zones of the growth plate. Note that the epiphysis is above the reserve zone and the metaphysis is below the hypertrophic zone. Reproduced with permission from Brighton CT: Structure and function of the growth plate.

The zones are ordered such that metabolic activity and maturation increases the farther the cells are located from the joint surface. Closest to the surface (ie, nearest the epiphysis) is the reserve zone. The cells in this zone produce cartilaginous matrix, primarily in the form of type II collagen, which is used for eventual ossification into bone. These cells do not actively divide, nor are they very metabolically active; accordingly, they have the poorest blood supply.

Below the reserve zone, moving toward the metaphysis, is the proliferative zone. Within this zone, the cells are stacked in columns. These columns of cells synthesize proteoglycans, thereby contributing to the extracellular matrix. This region, characterized by synthesis and cell division, has the most extensive blood supply within the growth plate. This blood supply provides nutrition, of course, but also allows hormonal signals to reach their targets in the growth plate effectively. The third zone of the growth plate, the hypertrophic zone, lies closest to the calcified bone of the metaphysis. The cells in this zone are unusually large and plump; hence, the name “hypertrophic.” This zone of the growth plate is highly active metabolically, even though it has a poor blood supply. It therefore relies on anaerobic metabolism and uses stored glycogen as its source of energy. It is also the region that participates in mineralization of the cartilage. Calcium is stored in the cells in the upper levels of the hypertrophic zones. In the lower levels of the hypertrophic zone, these cells liberate their calcium in order to assist in matrix mineralization. 1 The actual process of matrix mineralization occurs at the interface between the hypertrophic zone and the metaphysis: the zone of provisional calcification. Within this area, vascular invasion allows osteoblasts to arrive and replace the calcified cartilage with bone. This bone is a primitive, less-organized form called woven bone. In time, this tissue will be replaced by mature lamellar bone via the process of bone remodeling. The distinction between woven and lamellar bone is one of material orientation: the fibers of woven bone are haphazard, whereas lamellar bone aligns the structure in the direction of load. Blood does not flow easily through the physis; the intramedullary blood supply does not reach the epiphysis or secondary centers of ossification. Accordingly, in children, whose growth plates are open, the main blood supply to the epiphysis is a direct epiphyseal artery. This artery loses its prominence once the growth plates close at skeletal maturity. Numerous circulating hormones affect growth plate activity. Thyroid hormone (thyroxine), growth hormone, parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcitonin, and testosterone are among the hormones used to regulate growth plate physiology. These hormones can stimulate matrix synthesis, cell division, and calcification (and thus growth plate closure). The precise method and zone of action of these hormones are beyond the scope of this text. Even without entirely understanding their mechanisms of action, however, it is clear that abnormalities of these hormones can significantly affect the development of the human skeleton.2
