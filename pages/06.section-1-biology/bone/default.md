title: '1.1 Bone'

Bone is living, dynamic tissue that affects three main functions of the body: skeletal homeostasis (providing structure to house the internal organs as well as a system of pulleys and levers to move the body), mineral homeostasis (storing and releasing ions), and hematopoiesis (accommodating the machinery of blood cell formation). As living tissue, bone is in a state of continuous flux and renewal; osteoclasts resorb bone, and osteoblasts create newbone. This process allows ions to be released and stored. It also repairs areas of structural damage. Most bone forms according to the cartilage model, a process called endochondral ossification. The process of bone growth and development, therefore, is one of transformation from a cartilage skeleton in utero to one made entirely of bone in the adult. The pediatric skeleton contains remnants of this cartilage skeleton, the cartilaginous growth plate or physis. The physis is active metabolically and allows the pediatric skeleton to grow longitudinally; however, it is also structurally weaker than bone, which makes the pediatric skeleton susceptible to a class of diseases and injuries not seen in the adult.
